# Implementation Tasks: Real-Time Voice-Controlled Multi-Agent System

## Phase 1: Environment and Project Setup
1. **Repository & Environment Setup:**
   - Initialize a new repository.
   - Create a Python virtual environment.
   - Install dependencies:
     - Agno framework (`pip install -U agno`)
     - FastAPI, Uvicorn for the backend WebSocket server (`pip install fastapi uvicorn`)
     - Google Gen AI SDK (for Gemini LLM integration) using your chosen package (e.g. `pip install google-genai`)
   - Set environment variables for your Google API credentials (including the key for Multimodal Live API and Gemini 1.5 Flash).

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Initialize a new Next.js project.
   - Configure project structure and put in place the basic UI for handling user audio input and output.
   - Prepare a WebSocket client (using the Next.js API routes or a custom component) that will communicate with your backend service.

## Phase 2: Backend – WebSocket Server & API Integration
1. **WebSocket Server Implementation:**
   - Use FastAPI to set up a WebSocket endpoint that receives live audio streams from the Next.js frontend.
   - Integrate with the Google Multimodal Live API to transmit audio/text input and receive corresponding responses.
   - Ensure the WebSocket handler maintains persistent sessions (the API will handle VAD and low-latency streaming internally).

2. **Google Multimodal Live API Integration:**
   - Implement the connection logic using the Google Gen AI SDK.
   - Configure the session with the model ID set to Gemini 1.5 Flash (for example, by using a parameter like `model="gemini-1.5-flash"` – confirm the exact naming convention from the Google documentation).
   - Validate that all streaming (input and response) is channeled solely through the Multimodal Live API.

## Phase 3: Agent Implementation using Agno Framework
1. **Voice Agent Development:**
   - Build the voice agent using the Agno framework.
   - Implement logic to:
     - Receive audio through the WebSocket (after being processed by the API).
     - Forward incoming audio to Gemini 1.5 Flash for intent analysis using the Google Gen AI SDK.
     - Detect key phrases (e.g., “check my calendar for Friday night”) via the lightweight Gemini LLM.
     - Delegate the task to the appropriate specialized agent.
     - Route the aggregated response back to the user via the Multimodal Live API.

2. **Integrate Gemini 1.5 Flash:**
   - Set up the lightweight LLM in the voice agent for intent parsing.
   - Create an interface for sending user prompts to the Gemini 1.5 Flash model and receiving responses.
   - Ensure that LLM calls are optimized for low latency.

3. **Specialized Agents (Calendar, Email, Web Search):**
   - Implement each agent as a separate Agno module:
     - **Calendar Agent:**  
       Create an API stub or integrate with a real Google Calendar API for checking availability.
     - **Email Agent:**  
       Build functionality to read or summarize emails (initially simulate responses if no live API integration is available).
     - **Web Search Agent:**  
       Integrate with a web search tool (you can start with a dummy implementation that later calls Google Search if needed).

## Phase 4: Next.js Frontend Integration
1. **User Interface Development:**
   - Develop a modern UI in Next.js that captures user voice commands using, for example, the Web Audio API.
   - Display real-time status, such as when processing is underway and when a response is available.
   - Integrate the frontend WebSocket client to connect to the backend WebSocket server.

2. **Frontend and Backend Connection Testing:**
   - Test the entire flow by sending voice commands from the Next.js UI.
   - Verify that the commands are sent to the backend, processed via Gemini 1.5 Flash and the appropriate agents, and then that the final audio response is streamed back and played on the frontend.

## Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance
1. **Unit and Integration Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for individual agent functions.
   - Create end-to-end tests that simulate user voice commands and validate the proper delegation and response streaming.
   - Test WebSocket connectivity between the Next.js frontend and the FastAPI backend.

2. **Performance and Latency Testing:**
   - Confirm that the overall system meets low latency requirements (relying on the API’s built-in performance optimizations).
   - Validate session persistence, proper interruption handling (as managed by the Multimodal Live API), and rapid response aggregation.

## Phase 6: Deployment
1. **Containerization & Deployment:**
   - Containerize both the backend (FastAPI + Agno agents) and the Next.js frontend using Docker.
   - Deploy to an environment optimized for low latency (e.g., Google Cloud Run or a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud).
   - Configure secure WebSocket communications (using HTTPS and WSS).

2. **Monitoring & Logging:**
   - Set up logging and monitoring for WebSocket sessions and agent response times.
   - Use Google’s monitoring tools to oversee API usage, latency, and error rates.
   - Plan for scaling the system as additional agents are added or request volume increases.
